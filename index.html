      <h2 id="welcome-to-cardinal-interiors">Welcome to Cardinal Interiors</h2>
      <p>Entering the Calgary market with 15 years experience in renovations, restoration,
        custom interiors and new developments, Cardinal Interiors looks to make every
        interaction one that will be remembered well.</p>
      <h2 id="what-we-do">What We Do</h2>
      <p>Specializing in all aspects of interior work, from drywall to texture, flooring
        to custom woodwork, and everything in between, Cardinal can do it all. Having
        seen the ever growing number of “fly-by-night” companies out to make a quick
        dollar off of unsuspecting customers, Jay, Kevin, and Tim have committed
        themselves to provide a great product at a fair price, but more importantly
        to do so while building great relationships.</p>
      <h2 id="free-estimates">Free Estimates</h2>
      <p>This means free estimates, absolute communication up front about pricing and
        process, and an openness to just sit and have a coffee and discuss any concerns
        that may arise during construction.</p>
      <h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
      <p>Do you have an idea that you would like to see come to life in your project?
        Let us know! We are excited to have your input throughout the process. Is
        there something about the process that you don’t understand? Let us help!
        We value the chance to explain what it is that we do! Our core value is people
        and we want the opportunity to show you what a great construction experience
        is.</p>
